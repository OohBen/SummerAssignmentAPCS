Read Chapter 4 in Think Java.

While we haven't discussed this yet, Java is an Object Oriented
language. That means pretty much everything is written inside of a
Object. Take our Hello.java:

```java
  public class Hello {
      public static void main(String[] args){
          System.out.println("Hello world!");
      }
  }
```

The file contains a class named Hello. The  **main** that we wrote inside the Hello class is a
**method**. For those of you with Python or Javascript backgrounds, for
the time being you can think of a method as a function declared inside
of a class.

Let's look at the anatomy of a method
```java
public static RETURNTYPE NAME(ARGUMENTS){
 BODY
}
```

For now we'll treat **public** and **static** as boilerplate. We'll
explain them when we get to Objects. The name of the method can be any
valid identifier. The method name **main** though, has a special
meaning. It's what the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) runs automatically
when you run your program. The return type for main is **void**. That
means it doesn't return any value. For this section we will limit
ourselves to **void** methods. Here's a program with two
methods. The first is void and prints out **Hello world!**, the second
is our required **main** method.


```java
  public class Hello {

      public static void printHello(){
          System.out.println("Hello world!");
      }

      public static void main(String[] args){
          String s;
          printHello();
      }

  }
```


Java does have a **return** statement like other languages but in the
case of a void method, if you omit it, the function will just return
to the caller after the last statement. If a void method has and
encounters a **return** statement, control is immediately returned to
the caller.

The last piece of the method are the ARGUMENTS. The ARGUMENTS are a
list of arguments sent to the method. This acts in the same way as
arguments to a Python or Javascript function except you have to
specify types. For example, if you had a Python function f that accepted
first an integer into parameter **a** and a then  string into parameter
**b** and returned a string you would write


```python
def f(a,b):
  # do stuff
```


In Java the corresponding method would be:
```java
public static void m(int a, String b){
  // dostuff
}
```



# Practice
Now you can start to solve the codingBat functions

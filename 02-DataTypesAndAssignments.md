# Data Types

This section deals with basic data types. Java differs from Python, Scheme, Netlogo and
Javascript in that you have to declare variables before you use them
and in that declaration tell the compiler what type of data they'll
represent.

# Required Reading
Please read the chapter (indicated sections) and assess your ability using the interactive questions for those sections.
While reading, take notes. It is important to keep track of any vocabulary that you didn't already know, so that you can remember to get clarifiaction in class.

# APCS summer assignment
This pre-coursework is designed to ensure that all students entering the APCS course have the same prior knowledge. The goal is to give all students the opportunity to succeed, no matter what their intro experience was like.

Remember that you should try to learn this material, not "get it done so you don't lose points". This assignment is NOT intended to becompleted in one sitting at the last minute (as many Stuyvesant students think is ideal). You should spread out the work over the course of 1-2 weeks. Complete a little every day, and you will thank yourself later. 

This is not to say that all students will have the same experience while completing the pre-coursework. It may be the case that you struggle with it, but it is better to struggle a little over the summer when you are not taking a full courseload.

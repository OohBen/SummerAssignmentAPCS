# Reading 
* Read chapters two and three from [Think Java | 2, 3](https://books.trinket.io/thinkjava/)
* While reading, take note of any vocabulary that you didn't already know, and revisit them later.

This section deals with basic data types. Java differs from Python, Scheme, Netlogo and
Javascript in that you have to declare variables before you use them
and in that declaration tell the compiler what type of data they'll
represent.

For example in Python, if you wanted to use a variable **intval** to hold
an integer value and **doubval** a floating point number you could just
write:

```python
intval = 5
doubval = 123.45
```

whereas in Java you have to first declare the variables and then
assign them:

```java
int intval;
double doubval;

intval = 5;
doubval = 123.45
```
You can combine the steps:
```java
int intval = 5;
double doubval = 123.45;
```

Read the chapters for details.

# Before you start
Your computer most likely hides the file extension from you when you look at file names on your computer.
Hello.txt just looks like Hello and the icon is a text file.

# Text Editor
* If you are going to write your first Java program you will need a plain text editor. Do not use a word processor to write code!
* I will suggest using [Atom](https://atom.io) but any PLAIN TEXT editor will work.

* I strongly advise you to avoid any large IDE's for this class. Eclipse, or IntelliJ and many other programs have more advanced features but are more than you need. Also, they can cause problems if you don't know what you are doing (and even if you do).




# Command Line Interface


* Now you will be using a terminal, this is a command line interface (CLI) to your computer.
* In Windows the terminal is called "command prompt", on linux and Mac it is just Terminal. Learning about your terminal is beyond the scope of the preliminary coursework, but it is enough to know that your terminal needs to know which directory your files are in before it can use those files. We will use a shortcut for now by opening the terminal in the correct directory automatically.

* [How to open a terminal in a particular directory](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/open-command-window-terminal-window-specific-folder-windows-mac-linux/) For windows, just use the PowerShell option which is in your menu by default.

* Make a folder for your APCS work wherever you normally keep your school documents/files. When you need the terminal, make sure to open that directory with the terminal.
